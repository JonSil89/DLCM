Lifecycle Management Model: “Device Onboarding → Maintenance → Decommissioning"

# Device Lifecycle Management (DLCM) Model

**Phases:**  
_Onboarding → Active Use & Maintenance → Offboarding & Decommissioning_

---

## 1. Onboarding

- Devices are procured, registered, and configured based on company standards.
- Tasks include:
  - Assigning devices to users or departments
  - Installing required software and applications
  - Enforcing security policies (e.g. MDM, encryption)
- Initial setup is documented in the asset register.

---

## 2. Active Use & Maintenance

- Devices are actively used by employees or teams.
- Ongoing lifecycle tasks:
  - Software updates and security patching
  - Hardware repairs and troubleshooting
  - Helpdesk support and ticketing
  - Performance and compliance monitoring
- All events (repairs, ownership changes) are logged and traceable.

---

## 3. Offboarding & Decommissioning

- Triggered when devices are:
  - Replaced
  - No longer needed
  - Returned after employee offboarding
- Actions include:
  - Secure data wiping or factory reset
  - Return logistics or certified e-waste recycling
  - Final update in the asset management system
- Devices are marked as retired, reused, sold, or recycled per policy.

✅ **Goal:** Full lifecycle visibility, security, and compliance.
