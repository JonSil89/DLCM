## üìò Overview

This document outlines the full lifecycle of devices managed within the organization. The purpose is to ensure traceability, security, and compliance across all stages: onboarding, active use, and decommissioning.

## üì¶ 1. Onboarding

**Goal:** Prepare a device for secure and compliant operational use.

**Steps:**

1. Procure device through approved vendor.
2. Register device in Asset Management System (AMS).
3. Assign to user or department.
4. Install:
   - OS and security updates
   - Required enterprise applications
   - Endpoint protection (EDR/AV)
5. Enroll in MDM (Mobile Device Management).
6. Record configuration baseline and ownership.

**Automation Tip:** Use ClickUp + Zapier to auto-create onboarding tasks when a new device is registered.

## üîÑ 2. Active Use & Maintenance

**Goal:** Maintain operational integrity, performance, and security.

**Tasks:**

- Monitor device health and uptime (via RMM).
- Apply security patches (monthly).
- Log all incidents and support cases.
- Review compliance quarterly.
- Replace batteries/parts if needed.

**Common Issues:**

| Issue              | Description                                  | Resolution                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Device overheating | Fan failure or dust clogging vents           | Clean or replace fan          |
| Network loop       | Duplicate cabling or unmanaged switch error  | See [Network Loop Issue](#-network-loop-issue-verkkoluuppi) |

## üßØ Network Loop Issue (Verkkoluuppi)

**Definition:** A misconfiguration where packets endlessly circulate the network.

**Detected by:**
- STP reconfigurations
- Broadcast storms
- Device log alerts

**Fix:**
1. Unplug suspected loop port.
2. Check STP configuration.
3. Apply BPDU Guard or loop detection.

## üßπ 3. Offboarding & Decommissioning

**Goal:** Securely remove devices from operation.

**Steps:**

1. Unassign device from user in AMS.
2. Perform secure data wipe (e.g. DoD 5220.22-M).
3. Remove from MDM.
4. Update lifecycle status to "Retired".
5. Send device to:
   - Recycling (certified vendor), or
   - Storage (if reusable)

**Compliance Note:** Ensure audit log is complete before disposal.
